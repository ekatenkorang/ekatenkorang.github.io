# Graduate Research Assistant - ML Applications and Network Security
 Welcome to my GitHub.io page!
## About Me!
I am a graduate research assistant with a thirst for expertise in applications of machine learning (ML) and the security and privacy of networks and power systems. My research interests are twofold: with regards to power systems, I aim to explore applications of machine learning to make them more efficient. Specifically, I am interested in fault detection, power system optimization, and smart grids. In the field of networking, I focus on congestion control, network security, and the development of protocols with quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS), along with security and performance guarantees.

## Projects
### Power Systems:
#### Transformer Inter-turn Fault Detection using Artificial Intelligence

In this project, I designed a novel technique to detect both the location and severity of inter-turn faults in transformers using artificial intelligence. Previous methods were only capable of detecting fault location. By processing the transformer current waveforms through wavelet analysis and feeding them into a convolutional neural network (CNN), I developed a CNN-based model that predicts both the location and severity of inter-turn faults. I will provide example images of healthy and faulty transformers that were used in the training process, as well as confusion matrices that validate the findings.

#### Cascading Failure Prediction using Deep Learning

The objective of this project was to enhance the prediction of cascading failures in power systems. Cascading failures occur when one or multiple lines of the power system fail, overloading other lines and eventually leading to significant load shedding and blackouts. To improve the prediction accuracy, I simulated a 118-bus system in Simulink and utilized deep learning techniques to predict the number of failed lines. By employing selected features and classifying the cascading failures into no, small, and large cascades, I achieved promising results. I will showcase the obtained results through relevant pictures.

### Networking
#### Transmit Power Optimization in IRS-NOMA Systems

This project explores machine learning approaches to minimize transmit power in two-cell intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems with joint detection. To tackle the original optimization problem, I converted the joint optimization problem of power allocation and phase shift into a pure phase shift determination problem, thus rendering it tractable.

#### Classification and Detection of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs)

In this project, I designed and implemented a machine learning algorithm to classify and detect man-in-the-middle attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). I generated data using a simulated SDN environment with the help of NS-3. By leveraging machine learning techniques, I achieved accurate detection and classification of these security threats.

### Personal
#### Predicting the NBA MVP using Machine Learning

Inspired by an article from Bleacher Report in 2015 that determined the 100 greatest players of all time using six features, I utilized a deep neural network (DNN) to establish the relationship between these features and a player's ranking. Based on this mapping, I predicted how the list would look today. Below, you can find the updated rankings:
