## About Me!
Hey there! I'm Edwin Tenkorang, an electrical engineer with a deep passion for the exciting intersections of security, privacy, computer and wireless networking, as well as power systems and smart grids. I love exploring how technology can empower and protect us in our increasingly connected world. I am driven by the desire to leverage technology to protect and empower individuals in our increasingly interconnected world and aim to become a top researcher in the interdisciplinary of field of security and privacy.
My research interests span the boundaries between academia and industry, driven by a passion for practical solutions and real-world impact. I believe that by combining artificial intelligence with research in security and privacy in the context of power systems and networking, we can build more efficient, secure, and resilient infrastructures that meet the ever-growing demands of our digital society.
With a strong foundation in electrical engineering, a deep curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning, I am excited to contribute to cutting-edge research in these areas. I believe that bridging theory and practice can pave the way for a safer, more connected future.
Being a Teaching and Research Assistant in the Department of Electrical/Electronic Engineering was an incredible experience. I worked closely with my mentor, Prof. E.A. Frimpong, and contributed to lectures while gaining practical insights into power system operation and protection. I also had the chance to work on some remarkable research projects. One of my favorites involved developing a deep learning technique that predicts and classifies cascading failures in power grids. 
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a firm believer in the power of hands-on experience. As a Cybersecurity Research Assistant at the University Information Technology Services, which develops and controls all of K.N.U.S.T's IT deliverables, I had the opportunity to dive into network access control configurations, earn sponsored certifications, and explore open-source tools for logical security mapping.
Beyond my professional endeavors, I actively participate in initiatives promoting diversity and empowerment. One of the initiatives I am actively involved in is BecauseSheCan. As an event planner for the December For Women Who Code program, our aim was to empower women who are tech-savvy and skilled but lack access to laptops. We organized a laptop donation program and were able to provide 5 laptops to deserving women. Witnessing the joy and transformation these laptops brought to their lives was truly inspiring. Another organization close to my heart is the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). I participated in an outreach program where we assisted children in preparing for the BECE (Basic Education Certificate Examination). It was fulfilling to share my knowledge and help these young minds navigate their educational journeys.
Beyond my academic and volunteering pursuits, I have a grand vision. My ultimate goal is to revolutionize engineering and create a product that has a significant impact on the African landscape. I believe that through innovation, entrepreneurship, and engineering, we can bring about transformative change, addressing the unique challenges and opportunities present in Africa.
## Projects
### Power Systems:
#### Transformer Inter-turn Fault Detection using Artificial Intelligence
In this project, I designed a novel technique to detect both the location and severity of inter-turn faults in transformers using artificial intelligence. Previous methods were only capable of detecting fault location. By processing the transformer current waveforms through wavelet analysis and feeding them into a convolutional neural network (CNN), I developed a CNN-based model that predicts both the location and severity of inter-turn faults. I will provide example images of healthy and faulty transformers that were used in the training process, as well as confusion matrices that validate the findings.

#### Cascading Failure Prediction using Deep Learning

The objective of this project was to enhance the prediction of cascading failures in power systems. Cascading failures occur when one or multiple lines of the power system fail, overloading other lines and eventually leading to significant load shedding and blackouts. To improve the prediction accuracy, I simulated a 118-bus system in Simulink and utilized deep learning techniques to predict the number of failed lines. By employing selected features and classifying the cascading failures into no, small, and large cascades, I achieved promising results. I will showcase the obtained results through relevant pictures.

### Networking
#### Transmit Power Optimization in IRS-NOMA Systems

This project explores machine learning approaches to minimize transmit power in two-cell intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems with joint detection. To tackle the original optimization problem, I converted the joint optimization problem of power allocation and phase shift into a pure phase shift determination problem, thus rendering it tractable.

#### Classification and Detection of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs)

In this project, I designed and implemented a machine learning algorithm to classify and detect man-in-the-middle attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). I generated data using a simulated SDN environment with the help of NS-3. By leveraging machine learning techniques, I achieved accurate detection and classification of these security threats.

### Personal
#### Predicting the NBA MVP using Machine Learning

Inspired by an article from Bleacher Report in 2015 that determined the 100 greatest players of all time using six features, I utilized a deep neural network (DNN) to establish the relationship between these features and a player's ranking. Based on this mapping, I predicted how the list would look today. Below, you can find the updated rankings:
